## this version will be released on 22.4.2023
- ##### rewrited the combat system player hit calculations - hopefully fixed all bugs that made enemies unkillable under certain circumstances
- ##### fixed stats not being reseted correctly on death or on leaving to main menu 
- ##### fixed a bug which will lead into unequipable weapons
- ##### fixed a bug which would block you from opening the "roll credits" menu
- ##### fixed some wall colliders that you could walk through
- ##### fixed a bug which let you easily abuse the fake floor puzzle room by quickly clicking on "fast" or "jump" walking speed presets (adjusted the gravity to be 10x the normal value lol)
- ##### fixed a bug which prevented you from picking up the Warhammer and Shield items after you've dropped them onto the ground

- ##### fixed a bug which lead to strength potion actually not being dropped when dropped onto the ground
- ##### fixed a bug which lead to the game sometimes loading you into the settings menu instead of the main menu

- ##### adjusted sound volumes of certain gates and enemies 
- ##### fixed a bug that caused weird calculations on item equipping
- ##### fixed a bug that prevented you from picking up iron and gold key after you've dropped it
